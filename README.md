## File description

This repository contains Anki decks made by me based on existing resources. The table shows details for each deck:

| Filename | Target language | Question language | Source | Focus | Orthography |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| `b21.apkg` | Breton | French | [brezhoneg21.com](http://brezhoneg21.com) | Technical vocabulary | peurunvan |
| `bha.apkg` | Breton | English | Denez/Delaporte, _Brezhoneg … buan hag aes_, 1977 | Basic vocabulary | peurunvan |
| `clappya.apkg` | Cornish | English | Williams, _Clappya Kernowek_, 1997 | General vocabulary | UCR |
| `syntaxe.apkg` | Breton | French | Davalan, _Hentenn Oulpan 1_, 2000 | Sentence structure | peurunvan |

These decks were ported from Memrise (which was [made very easy](https://github.com/wilddom/memrise2anki-extension)) and contain write-in answer fields as they’re currently my preferred format. Decks are named in a way that will group them as subdecks by language.

## Using the decks

`bha.apkg` and `clappya.apkg` in particular are based on progressive textbooks, so it would be sensible to learn vocabulary in chapter order. This can be done by creating a filtered deck and pasting e.g. `deck:Breton::Brezhoneg … buan hag aes tag:"chron::levels::01"` into the search field; then when all cards in this deck have “to review” status, replacing `01` with `02`, and so on.

## Recommended add-ons

The [Hierarchical Tags Add-On](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1835859645) is recommended.

## To do

* Add more decks (specifically, Cornish vocabulary from my beginners’ class)
